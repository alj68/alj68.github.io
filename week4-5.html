    <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <p> Week 4 was relatively slow in progress and I struggled to sift through ASL data. Many were outdated, lacked the information I needed, or had ambiguous glossing conventions.</p>
      <p> I am hoping to find data suitable for implementing a BERT model, since most successful WSD research uses BERT.</p>
      <p> As of now, I've explored: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> ASL-Lex </li>
        <li> ASL-Citizen </li>
        <li> SignBank </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Most datasets seem to be optimized for sign language recognition, making this step rather difficult. I hope to find better data, or figure out how to combine different datasets to suit my needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <p> At this point, I realized I wanted to replicate previous WSD tasks. I was still struggling since I did not have English/ASL sentence pairs (That is, an English sentence with an ASL Gloss translation sentence)</p>
    <p> Thankfully, CV redirected me to ASLLRP Signbank, which provided me the sentence-pairs I was searching for. The website is incredibly confusing and slow, making my search quite frustrated. I was able to extract ~2000 pairs, but I am unsure if there are more I'm unaware of.</p>
    <p> I realized I should shift my focus to unsupervised training, since I am primarily relying on parallel language data. Instead of BERT (it failed), I hope to explore how Seq2Seq models function for English-ASL translation.</p>
    <p> For next week's presentation, I hope to show example of why I swapped BERT for Seq2Seq (essencially, why BERT failed). Then, I hope to figure out how I can reformat my research question to reflect my new WSD approach. </p>
