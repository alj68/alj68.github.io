    <p>This project explores how to improve sign look-up for American Sign Language by incorporating context. Since English words can have multiple sign translations and one sign can match several words, this tool proposes a smarter approach: users enter a full sentence, then select which word they want translated. The goal is to help identify the ASL sign that best captures the intended meaning.</p>
